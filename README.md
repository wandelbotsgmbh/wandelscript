# Wandelscript

## Introduction

Wandelscript is a robust framework designed for defining, parsing, type checking, and executing advanced scripting capabilities for robot automation. It integrates grammar-based parsing, runtime execution, and plugin extensibility, making it suitable for complex robot programming scenarios.

## Features

- **Grammar Parsing**: The Wandelscript grammar is defined and easily extensible. It is powered by ANTLR4 to generate efficient parsers.
- **Runtime Execution**: Includes a runtime environment capable of executing Wandelscript programs with support for custom plugins and built-in functions.
- **Extensible Plugins**: Supports adding custom functionality via Python-based plugins for robot control, kinematics, vision, and more.
- **Built-in Libraries**: Provides libraries for mathematical operations, string manipulations, pose interpolations, and interaction with industrial systems like OPC UA.
- **Examples**: Comprehensive example scripts are available to demonstrate use cases such as collision handling, multi-robot coordination, and TCP manipulation.
- **Testing**: Includes a set of unit tests to validate the functionality of the built-in components and plugins.

## Grammar

The Wandelscript grammar is defined under `/wandelscript/grammar`. To generate the parser, use the following command:

```bash
cd wandelscript/grammar && poetry run antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 -visitor *.g4
```

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Core Modules**:
  - `runtime.py`: Implements the execution context for Wandelscript.
  - `action_queue.py`: Manages motion and action queues for robots.
  - `exception.py`: Defines custom exceptions for Wandelscript.
  - `datatypes.py`: Includes type definitions and helper functions.
  - `models.py`: Contains data models for serialization and execution.
  - `metamodel.py`: Facilitates runtime extensions and plugin registration.
- **Built-ins**: Found under `wandelscript/builtins`, these are pre-defined plugins for:
  - Kinematics (`kinematics.py`)
  - Math operations (`math.py`)
  - String manipulation (`string.py`)
  - Robotics control (`controller.py`, `collider.py`)
- **Plugins**: Add custom features like image processing or complex robot motions, defined in `plugins_addons.py`.
- **Examples**: Demonstrates Wandelscript's capabilities with real-world use cases in `wandelscript/examples/`.

## Dependencies

The project uses the Poetry dependency manager. Install the dependencies using:

```bash
poetry install
```

Key dependencies:
- Python 3.10+
- ANTLR4 for grammar processing
- wandelbots-nova for data types and interaction with robot
- Pydantic for data validation
- Additional libraries for AI streaming, OPC UA, and geometric algebra.

## Usage

1. **Run Scripts**: Use the `runtime.py` module to execute Wandelscript programs.
2. **Extend Functionality**: Add new plugins or built-ins to customize the scripting environment.
3. **Examples**: Refer to the `/examples` folder for sample Wandelscript files.
